# Electron gun power supply and monitoring controller

_Note_: This project is designed for a particular experiment so it will not
be much of use for anyone who's not working on exactly that experiment.

This is firmware for a simple electron gun controller that is controlling

* Up to four FUG HCP 14-6500 high voltage power supplies (acceleration
  voltage, Wehnelt cylinder, focus voltage and a single deflection voltage
  power supply)
* The voltage and current measured by FUG HCP 14-6500 can also be used for
  general monitoring and beam loss measurement

## External communication ports

* UART0 provides main communication interface (and is also used by avrdude
  during flashing - there is an Arduino bootloader flashed on the board so
  flash method ```·∫Åiring``` can be used via USB

* Other UARTs may be used for RS485 or other components later on

## Protocol

In contrast to other implementations this board supports an ASCII based
communication protocol. For synchronization all messages start with a
fixed synchronization pattern consisting of three dollar signs. Each command
is terminated via a CR LF or only LF (CR is simply ignored by the serial
parser). Numbers are transmitted as ASCII decimal numbers.
